1) Write out a generic SELECT statement.

SELECT <column1> FROM <table1> WHERE <conditions>;

2) Create a fun way to remember the order of operations in a SELECT statement, such as a mnemonic.

(S)elect (F)rom (W)here - SFW it up

3) Given this dogs table, write queries to select the following pieces of data:

Intake teams typically guess the breed of shelter dogs, so the breed column may have multiple words (for example, "Labrador Collie mix").

Display the name, gender, and age of all dogs that are part Labrador.

SELECT name, gender, age
FROM dogs
WHERE breed LIKE '%labrador%';

Display the ids of all dogs that are under 1 year old.

SELECT id
FROM dogs
WHERE age < 1;

Display the name and age of all dogs that are female and over 35lbs.

SELECT name, age
FROM dogs
WHERE gender = 'F' AND weight > 35;

Display all of the information about all dogs that are not Shepherd mixes.

SELECT *
FROM dogs
WHERE breed NOT LIKE '%shepherd%';

Display the id, age, weight, and breed of all dogs that are either over 60lbs or Great Danes.

SELECT id, age, weight, breed
FROM dogs
WHERE weight > 60 OR breed LIKE '%great dane%';

4) Given this cats table, what records are returned from these queries?

SELECT name, adoption_date FROM cats;
SELECT name, age FROM cats;

5) From the cats table, write queries to select the following pieces of data.
Display all the information about all of the available cats.
Display the name and sex of all cats who are 7 years old.
Find all of the names of the cats, so you don’t choose duplicate names for new cats.

6) List each comparison operator and explain when you would use it. Include a real world example for each.
If you can’t list these from memory, do these flashcards until you can!

7) From the cats table, what data is returned from these queries?
SELECT name FROM cats WHERE gender = ‘F’;
SELECT name FROM cats WHERE age <> 3;
SELECT ID FROM cats WHERE name != ‘Mushi’ AND gender = ‘M’;
